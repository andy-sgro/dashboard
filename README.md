# dashboard

This project involves building a one-page online dashboard for visualizing an SDG Cities Index that is both open-sourced and legally shareable. This includes a three-panel layout that dynamically resizes to based on the viewport. Panel-1 (top left) includes a leaflet map with interactable markers representing each city included. Panel-2 (right) contains a horizontal barplot indicating the various 'scores' for each indicator measured by the city/marker. Panel-2 can toggle a leader-laggard graph that indicates the min and max scores for each indicator with a circle marking the indicator score for the selected city. Panel-3 (bottom left) indicates the selected city name, a table including it's total score and relative ranking, and a vertical barplot sorting total scores from heighest to lowest with the current cities position highlighted.
